In this session we build and used a CNN for computer vision and used it on a binary classification problem using a classic dataset for image analysis.

Let's see if we can put what we learned to good use.

In the data folder you'll find two additional directories containing two computer vision challenges.

## Labradoodle va Fried Chicken

The first one, `labradoodle_friedchicken` is a fun exercise that tries to distinguish between friend chicken and the surpirisngly similar looking brown labradoodle. The data was taken from this github repository. There is a machine learning solution there, but you can take a look at that later. Try to apply what we have learned in class on this data set.

## Uninfected vs Infected

Simple histoloy staining of cell samples is a cheap, quick and easy method for visual analysis of cells. In this exercise you are tasked with building
