If you completed the exercises in the first session, you've evaluated the Abalone data set as either a:


- Scalar Regression,
- Binary Classificaiton, or
- Single-label, Multi-class Classification

problem. That was just setting up and running a network. Let's see if we can evaluate our models and improe on them.

In the previous exercises you were onlyu given 25% of the abalone data set. In the data directory you'll find from 10 to 100% of the data set.
